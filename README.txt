PYTHON INDEPENDENT STUDY FILES
------------------------------
These are files from an independent study done by Ari Rubinstein with Professor Heimann during the summer of 2007 at Carnegie Mellon University, Information Systems department.  The exercises are from John Zelle's book "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" first edition, 2003.  (The second edition may have slightly different problems and is updated for Python 3.x whereas first edition is Python 2.x)  The pages can be viewed using Python Server Pages or can be read directly.
