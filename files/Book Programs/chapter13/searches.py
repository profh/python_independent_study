import time, random

# Simple test function. You can use this interactively to time different
#    size searches. Here's an example call:
#       >>> from searches import *
#       >>> avgTime(binSearch, 5000, 10)
#    This reports the average time needed to find a random value in a list
#    of 5000 ints. The average is done over 10 trials.

def avgTime(search, n, trials):
    # build an ordered list of size n
    l1 = range(n)
    print "List built"

    # run a number of trials and compute average time
    sum = 0.0
    for i in range(trials):
        print i+1,                    # show progress
        target = random.randint(0,n)
        # Get system time just before search
        t0 = time.time()
        pos = search(target, l1)
        # Get system time just after search
        t1 = time.time()
        # Add elapsed time to sum
        sum = sum + (t1-t0)
    print "\naverage:", sum/trials
